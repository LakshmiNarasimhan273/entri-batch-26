What is JSX & Components?

Definition & Purpose:
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript files. Components are reusable, independent building blocks in React that return JSX to define what appears on the UI.

Why It Exists:
Traditional web development mixes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript across multiple files, making large applications hard to maintain. React introduced JSX and components to keep UI logic, structure, and behavior together in a manageable way.

Repeating the same HTML structure across multiple pages
Difficulty maintaining large UI codebases
Tight coupling between UI and business logic
Poor scalability when applications grow
